## ExchangeStozDAO: Decentralized Governance

### Token Description

**ExchangeStozDAO (STOZ)** is an ERC-20 token designed as a pure governance instrument for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that manages funds intended to cover operational, legal, regulatory, and strategic needs of the platform, always through community voting mechanisms.

### Technical Specifications

- **Symbol**: STOZ
- **Name**: ExchangeStozDAO
- **Standard**: ERC-20
- **Network**: Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
- **Contract Address**: `0xb74dCc3ee89a19741dCdeafF3F687Fd708c8c580`
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Type**: Pure Governance Token

### Purpose and Utility

The ExchangeStozDAO token serves as a mechanism for participation in the DAO's decentralized governance, enabling holders to:

1. **Voting Rights**: Participate in decisions regarding fund allocation through off-chain voting via Snapshot platform with minimum quorum requirements
2. **Proposal Rights**: Submit proposals for community consideration related to legal, regulatory, operational, marketing, and development expenses
3. **Transparency and Access**: Access public information regarding all decisions, transactions, and treasury status of the DAO
4. **Delegation**: Delegate voting power to other community members

### Governance Scope

Governance exercised through ExchangeStozDAO allows holders to propose, debate, and vote on resource allocation for:

#### Legal Expenses and Legal Advisory Services
- Specialized legal advisory
- Legal structuring of smart contracts
- General legal protection
- Defense in legal proceedings

#### Regulatory Compliance
- KYC/AML processes
- Regular audits
- Regulatory reviews
- Compliance with regulations in multiple jurisdictions

#### Licensing
- Obtaining licenses and permits
- Maintaining existing licenses
- Permit renewal
- Expansion to new jurisdictions

#### Operational Costs
- Coverage of fixed costs associated with DAO operations
- Decentralized infrastructure

- Brand development

#### Technological Development
- Technological development projects
- Operational improvements
- Research and development
- Other collectively approved initiatives

### Non-Security Structure

ExchangeStozDAO is structured as a pure governance token that **explicitly does NOT grant**:

- ❌ Participation in profits or earnings of any entity
- ❌ Rights to dividends or income distribution
- ❌ Equity participation or company ownership
- ❌ Expectation of investment return
- ❌ Any form of security or financial instrument

The token complies with the principles of utility governance tokens, where its value resides exclusively in the capacity to participate in decentralized decisions, not in economic expectations.

### Howey Test - Non-Security Analysis

Under the Howey test (used by the SEC), an instrument is a security if it meets **ALL** of these criteria:

1. **Investment of Money** ❓ (May apply)
2. **In a Common Enterprise** ❓ (May apply)
3. **With Expectation of Profits** ✅ **DOES NOT APPLY** - Tokens do NOT grant rights to profits
4. **Derived from the Efforts of Others** ✅ **DOES NOT APPLY** - Governance is exercised by the holders themselves

**Conclusion**: By eliminating elements 3 and 4 (rights to profits and expectation of return), the tokens do NOT meet the complete Howey test.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### Governance Token (ERC-20)

The ExchangeStozDAO token contract implements the standard ERC-20 interface with the following characteristics:

- **Standard ERC-20 Functions**: `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`, `totalSupply`, `decimals`, `name`, `symbol`
- **Permit Support**: EIP-2612 permit functionality for gasless approvals
- **Burn Functionality**: `burn` and `burnFrom` functions for token supply management
- **Ownership Management**: Ownable pattern with ownership transfer capabilities
- **Coded Restrictions**: The contract explicitly does NOT include functions for dividends, profits, or profit distribution

```solidity
// Current contract structure (ERC-20 Standard)
contract ExchangeStozDAO is ERC20 {
    // Standard ERC-20 functions
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    
    // Permit (EIP-2612) for gasless approvals
    function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external;
    
    // Burn functions
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) external;
    
    // EXPLICITLY DOES NOT include:
    // - function delegate(address delegatee) ❌ (Not implemented - governance is off-chain via Snapshot)
    // - function getVotes(address account) ❌ (Not implemented - governance is off-chain via Snapshot)
    // - function claimDividends() ❌
    // - function getCompanyProfitShare() ❌
    // - function transferEquity() ❌
}
```

**Note**: The current contract is a standard ERC-20 token. Governance functionality is implemented off-chain through the Snapshot platform, which uses token balances at specific blocks to determine voting power. This approach allows for gasless voting while maintaining transparency and verifiability.

#### Governance Platform (Off-Chain via Snapshot)

The DAO uses **Snapshot** as its governance platform for off-chain voting and proposal management:

- **Proposal Creation**: Any STOZ holder can create proposals on Snapshot
- **Off-Chain Voting**: All votes are recorded on Snapshot (gasless voting)
- **Voting Power**: Determined by token balance at a specific snapshot block
- **Minimum Quorum**: Minimum participation requirement for proposal validity
- **Transparency**: All proposals and votes are publicly visible on Snapshot
- **On-Chain Execution**: Approved proposals can be executed on-chain through multisig wallets

#### Treasury Management (Future Implementation)

Future treasury management may include:

- **Fund Storage**: Secure management of DAO assets in multisig wallets
- **Coded Restrictions**: Smart contract-based limits on allowed expense types
- **Address Whitelist**: List of approved addresses to receive funds
- **Multisig Integration**: Integration with Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) multisig wallets for enhanced security

### Token Economics

#### Circulating Supply

The ExchangeStozDAO token has a **Circulating Supply of 100,000,000 STOZ** tokens. This supply represents the total number of tokens currently in circulation and available for governance participation.

#### Reward Distribution

The unclaimed rewards from the token distribution are allocated according to the following structure:

#### Distribution Details

**Recipient Allocation (0.10%)**
- Address: `0x3559...923b`
- Purpose: Primary recipient allocation for community rewards and incentives

**Protocol Allocation (Available for Sale)**
- **Uniswap V3: STOZ-USDT**: 38.99%
  - Purpose: Liquidity provision for the STOZ/USDT trading pair on Uniswap V3
  - Ensures sufficient liquidity for token trading and price discovery
- **DAO Treasury SafeWallet**: 50.90%
  - Purpose: Secure treasury management for DAO operations and governance

**Airdrop Allocation (10.00%)**
- Address: `0x257fA3A32723F28f3B6a80d2E34852f21C51fb7E`
- Purpose: Strategic airdrop distribution to expand community participation and token distribution

This distribution structure ensures balanced allocation between community rewards, protocol liquidity, treasury management, and strategic airdrop distribution, fostering sustainable growth of the ExchangeStozDAO ecosystem.

### Governance Platform

#### Snapshot Integration

ExchangeStozDAO utilizes **Snapshot** as its primary governance platform for off-chain voting and proposal management. Snapshot is a decentralized voting platform that enables gasless, off-chain governance for DAOs.

**Snapshot Profile**: https://snapshot.box/#/profile/0x4aC5dCbA3b072Cd0496E10D1a7e191e2330390B8

Snapshot provides a user-friendly interface for creating, discussing, and voting on governance proposals without incurring gas fees. Holders of STOZ tokens can participate in governance by connecting their wallets to the Snapshot platform. The platform uses a snapshot of token balances at a specific block to determine voting power, ensuring fair representation of the community's interests. All proposals, discussions, and votes are transparently recorded and can be verified on-chain when proposals are executed.

#### Additional Web Interface

## Governance Model

### Voting Process

#### 1. Proposal Creation

Any STOZ holder can create a proposal that includes:

- **Title and Description**: Clear description of the purpose
- **Category**: Type of expense (legal, regulatory, operational, marketing, development)
- **Requested Amount**: Specific amount of funds required
- **Recipient**: Address that will receive the funds
- **Justification**: Reasons and benefits of the proposal
- **Timeline**: Deadlines and project milestones

#### 2. Review Period

Before voting, there is a review period where:

- The community can ask questions and make comments
- The proposer can provide additional information
- Minor modifications can be made to the proposal

#### 3. Voting

Voting is conducted through the Snapshot platform, which enables gasless, off-chain voting. Snapshot takes a snapshot of token balances at a specific block to determine voting power, allowing all community members to participate without incurring transaction fees. The voting process includes:

- **Duration**: Defined period (e.g., 7 days)
- **Minimum Quorum**: Minimum percentage of tokens that must participate
- **Required Majority**: Percentage of votes in favor needed for approval
- **Vote Weight**: Proportional to the amount of STOZ held
- **Snapshot Block**: Specific block number used to determine voting power

#### 4. Execution

Once approved:

- **Timelock**: Security delay before execution
- **Automatic Execution**: Transfer of funds as specified
- **Recording**: Transaction recorded on the blockchain

### Governance Parameters

#### Minimum Quorum

The minimum quorum is established as a percentage of the total tokens in circulation. This ensures that decisions have sufficient community participation.

#### Voting Period

The voting period is designed to balance:

- **Sufficient Time**: Allow all holders to have the opportunity to vote
- **Efficiency**: Not unnecessarily delay proposal execution

#### Timelock

The timelock provides a grace period after approval for:

- **Final Review**: Last opportunity to review approved proposals
- **Security**: Prevent immediate execution of malicious proposals
- **Transparency**: Give time for the community to learn about important decisions

### Vote Delegation

Holders can delegate their voting power through the Snapshot platform to:

- **Other Holders**: Community members they trust
- **Representatives**: Delegates representing specific interests
- **Delegation Protocols**: Automated delegation systems

Delegation on Snapshot can be:

- **Temporary**: For specific periods
- **Per Proposal**: Delegate only for specific proposals
- **Permanent**: Until explicitly revoked

**Note**: Delegation is managed off-chain through Snapshot's delegation features, allowing holders to delegate their voting power without on-chain transactions.

### Transparency and Auditing

#### Public Dashboard

Real-time visualization of:

- **Treasury Balance**: Funds available in the DAO
- **Active Proposals**: Proposals in voting or review
- **Proposal History**: All past proposals with results

## ExchangeStozDAO: Gobernanza Descentralizada

### Descripción del Token

**ExchangeStozDAO (STOZ)** es un token ERC-20 diseñado como instrumento de gobernanza puro para una Organización Autónoma Descentralizada (DAO) que gestiona fondos destinados a cubrir necesidades operativas, legales, regulatorias y estratégicas de la plataforma, siempre mediante mecanismos de votación comunitaria.

### Especificaciones Técnicas

- **Símbolo**: STOZ
- **Nombre**: ExchangeStozDAO
- **Estándar**: ERC-20
- **Red**: Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
- **Dirección del Contrato**: `0xb74dCc3ee89a19741dCdeafF3F687Fd708c8c580`
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Tipo**: Token de Gobernanza Puro

### Propósito y Utilidad

El token ExchangeStozDAO sirve como mecanismo de participación en la gobernanza descentralizada de la DAO, permitiendo a los holders:

1. **Derechos de Votación**: Participar en decisiones sobre el uso de fondos mediante votación off-chain a través de la plataforma Snapshot con quorum mínimo
2. **Derechos de Propuesta**: Presentar propuestas para consideración de la comunidad relacionadas con gastos legales, regulatorios, operativos, marketing y desarrollo
3. **Transparencia y Acceso**: Acceder a información pública sobre todas las decisiones, transacciones y estado del tesoro de la DAO
4. **Delegación**: Delegar poder de voto a otros miembros de la comunidad

### Alcance de Gobernanza

La gobernanza ejercida a través de ExchangeStozDAO permite a los holders proponer, debatir y votar sobre la asignación de recursos para:

#### Gastos Legales y de Asesoría Jurídica
- Asesoría jurídica especializada
- Estructuración legal de contratos inteligentes
- Protección legal general
- Defensa en procedimientos legales

#### Cumplimiento Regulatorio
- Procesos de KYC/AML
- Auditorías regulares
- Revisiones normativas
- Cumplimiento con regulaciones en múltiples jurisdicciones

#### Licenciamiento
- Obtención de licencias y permisos
- Mantenimiento de licencias existentes
- Renovación de permisos
- Expansión a nuevas jurisdicciones

#### Costos Operativos
- Cobertura de costos fijos asociados al funcionamiento de la DAO
- Infraestructura descentralizada
- Servicios de hosting y almacenamiento
- Mantenimiento de sistemas

#### Marketing y Expansión

- Desarrollo de marca

#### Desarrollo Tecnológico
- Proyectos de desarrollo tecnológico
- Mejoras operativas
- Investigación y desarrollo
- Otras iniciativas aprobadas colectivamente

### Estructura No-Security

ExchangeStozDAO está estructurado como un token de gobernanza puro que **explícitamente NO otorga**:

- ❌ Participación en ganancias o utilidades de ninguna entidad
- ❌ Derechos a dividendos o distribución de ingresos
- ❌ Participación accionaria o propiedad de la compañía
- ❌ Expectativa de retorno de inversión
- ❌ Cualquier forma de security o valor mobiliario

El token cumple con los principios de tokens utilitarios de gobernanza, donde su valor reside únicamente en la capacidad de participar en decisiones descentralizadas, no en expectativas económicas.

### Test de Howey - Análisis de No-Security

Bajo el test de Howey (utilizado por la SEC), un instrumento es un security si cumple **TODOS** estos criterios:

1. **Inversión de Dinero** ❓ (Puede aplicarse)
2. **En una Empresa Común** ❓ (Puede aplicarse)
3. **Con Expectativa de Ganancias** ✅ **NO APLICA** - Los tokens NO otorgan derechos a ganancias
4. **Derivadas del Esfuerzo de Otros** ✅ **NO APLICA** - La gobernanza es ejercida por los propios holders

**Conclusión**: Al eliminar los elementos 3 y 4 (derechos a utilidades y expectativa de retorno), los tokens NO cumplen el test de Howey completo.

## Arquitectura Técnica

### Contratos Inteligentes

#### Token de Gobernanza (ERC-20)

El contrato del token ExchangeStozDAO implementa la interfaz estándar ERC-20 con las siguientes características:

- **Funciones ERC-20 Estándar**: `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`, `totalSupply`, `decimals`, `name`, `symbol`
- **Soporte Permit**: Funcionalidad permit (EIP-2612) para aprobaciones sin gas
- **Funcionalidad de Quema**: Funciones `burn` y `burnFrom` para gestión del suministro de tokens
- **Gestión de Propiedad**: Patrón Ownable con capacidades de transferencia de propiedad
- **Restricciones Codificadas**: El contrato explícitamente NO incluye funciones de dividendos, utilidades o distribución de ganancias

```solidity
// Estructura del contrato actual (Estándar ERC-20)
contract ExchangeStozDAO is ERC20 {
    // Funciones ERC-20 estándar
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    
    // Permit (EIP-2612) para aprobaciones sin gas
    function permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external;
    
    // Funciones de quema
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    function burnFrom(address from, uint256 amount) external;
    
    // EXPLÍCITAMENTE NO incluye:
    // - function delegate(address delegatee) ❌ (No implementado - gobernanza es off-chain vía Snapshot)
    // - function getVotes(address account) ❌ (No implementado - gobernanza es off-chain vía Snapshot)
    // - function claimDividends() ❌
    // - function getCompanyProfitShare() ❌
    // - function transferEquity() ❌
}
```

**Nota**: El contrato actual es un token ERC-20 estándar. La funcionalidad de gobernanza se implementa off-chain a través de la plataforma Snapshot, que utiliza balances de tokens en bloques específicos para determinar el poder de voto. Este enfoque permite votación sin gas mientras mantiene transparencia y verificabilidad.

#### Plataforma de Gobernanza (Off-Chain vía Snapshot)

La DAO utiliza **Snapshot** como su plataforma de gobernanza para votación off-chain y gestión de propuestas:

- **Creación de Propuestas**: Cualquier holder de STOZ puede crear propuestas en Snapshot
- **Votación Off-Chain**: Todas las votaciones se registran en Snapshot (votación sin gas)
- **Poder de Voto**: Determinado por el balance de tokens en un bloque de instantánea específico
- **Quorum Mínimo**: Requisito de participación mínima para validez de propuestas
- **Transparencia**: Todas las propuestas y votos son públicamente visibles en Snapshot
- **Ejecución On-Chain**: Las propuestas aprobadas pueden ejecutarse on-chain a través de wallets multisig

#### Gestión del Tesoro (Implementación Futura)

La gestión futura del tesoro puede incluir:

- **Almacenamiento de Fondos**: Gestión segura de activos de la DAO en wallets multisig
- **Restricciones Codificadas**: Límites basados en contratos inteligentes sobre tipos de gastos permitidos
- **Whitelist de Direcciones**: Lista de direcciones aprobadas para recibir fondos
